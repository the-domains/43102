This site is names for being member 43,102 @ The Grid. I like beta technology and signed up for The Grid back in 2015\. Today, the promise of future-funding has delivered!

So this site will just jump in, right here, somewhere near the middle, on May 1st, 2016, in Texas.

Please share your thoughts and remember, "the Internet is Forever" so play nice.

Again, welcome
