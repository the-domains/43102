Yes I stood in line for the Model 3, and I am glad I did.

Top 12 reasons why:

1. Line sitting for new tech is the closest I can come to Silicon Valley in Texas.
2. We didn't know what it would look like when we stood in line, which makes it really fun to meet other enthusiasts who are just as excited about their own imaginations as I am mine!
3. Just because Tesla might sell over 200,000 US models before the Model 3, doesn't mean there is no tax break (first 200,000 get $7,500, then next 6 mo. unlimited \# get $3,500, then following 6 mo. unlimited \# get $1,750 tax credit.)
4. Tesla doesn't deliver cars quickly anyway. What if I wanted one after the reveal, but the line was 100,000 people deep? I think even being \#5 in line, I'm still looking at a 2018 delivery date.
5. Tesla people are my people. I sat with a lawyer, a college student, an IT consultant, and a limo driver. Our ages and backgrounds ranged just as widely as our professions. what bonded us was an enthusiasm for living in the future.
6. I want a smaller car. The Model S is great (driven it, lovely) but practically, I prefer the mid-size Accord/Camry/A4/3-series size for parking and navigating.
7. Even if I had the money and the Model S was an ideal size, I couldn't bring myself to spend nearly $100,000 after options on a car. As it is the Model 3 will likely be the most expensive car I've owned, even with the tax break.
8. I want a car in a couple years. I love cars but I also keep them for a long time. currently sporting about 150,000 miles on a car that is closing in on 10 years old. it doesn't bother me that I won't be able to order for another year or take delivery for another 6-12 mo. after that.
9. Line sitting is not a singular experience, but it is pretty rare. Image a long airline flight...that lasts about 12 hours. Now imagine everyone on the flight is REALLY into the final destination.
10. The News van showed up. So did security. So did the lady who tried to jump to the front of the line with a tale about coming the morning before and being told she couldn't start the line that early. The preexisting line sitters summarily dispatched her to the 30-something-ish position to wait with the other people who overslept their alarm clock too.
11. I remember these experiences. I remember coming home with the first iPhone. I remember the bloggers interviewing us as we waited for iPad. I remember setting an alarm clock to order my Apple Watch (online orders not much fun, just sleepy.)
12. The deposit is fully refundable at any time.
