ADFS 3.0 and WAP (Formerly ADFS Proxy) are super powerful and really should not be so darn difficult to debug.

My issue is that they work...great...for a few days...then I start getting this Exception in my ADFS 3.0 server's Event Log:

> MSIS7042: The same client browser session has made '6' requests in the last '1' seconds

And the major kick in the pants, is that Googling is not reviewing any solutions that last.
