Systems Integration moves me. I get passionate about it. The promise is so basic. The execution can be so complex. The impact can change a business or a music genre.

I've been working on an integration project with CRM, Project Management, Financial, Inventory, and Service data.

When this is complete, it will enable a vision for the company to scale our world class customer service well beyond our current markets.
